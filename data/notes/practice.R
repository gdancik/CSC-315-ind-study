# 1) Enumerate the sample space for drawing 2 cards, without
#.   replacement, from a standard deck of 52 cards. Note:
#.   You need to use the 'combinations' function

# 2) Use classical probability to find the probability of getting
#.   a pair.


# 3) Use classical probability to find the probability of a 
#.   straight (2 cards in increasing or decreasing order)


# 4) Use empirical probability, and 10,000 simulations, to find 
#.   the probability of getting a pair.


# 5) Use empirical probability, and 10,000 simulations, to find
#.   the probability of getting a straight.


# 6) If weight loss from a diet is normally distributed with mean -1 pound
#.   and a standard deviation of 1.6 lbs, what is the probability that
#.   a person on this diet will lose weight?
